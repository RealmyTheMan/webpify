# `webpinator`

A small CLI tool to (even recursively) convert image files in a directory to WEBP, built on [`sharp`](https://npmjs.com/package/sharp).

## Usage

webpinator requires the [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime, _**not**_ Node.JS.

- To use directly without installing globally: `bunx webpinator -h`.
- To install globally: `bun i -g webpinator` and `webpinator -h`.
